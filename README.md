# GeneticsGame
I'm fiddling around with some concepts for a game. This game will be based on genetics and mutations and a lot of randomness.
The idea is that you are a researcher on some evil company which creates biological weapons. Think Umbrella Labs from Resident Evil.
Some ideas: you can do research on different animals/plants/bacteria etc with the goal of creating a powerful biological weapon.
Animals have different traits which will passed down to offspring. If both parents carry the same trait, the chance for this trait to be passed down will increase. You can inject animals with a virus with the hope of it mutating into a stronger virus.

Working on the file Animal now. Currently looking at how traits are carried from parents to offspring.
